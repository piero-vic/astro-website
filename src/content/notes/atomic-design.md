> Methodology for creating design systems.

## Atoms

- The most basic building blocks.
- Not very useful on their own.
- HTML tags, such as a label, a button, or an input.

## Molecules

- Combination of reusable atoms in its smallest fundamental unit.
- Backbone of our design system.
- _Do one thing and do it well._
- Example: _Search widget_.

## Organism

- Group of molecules joined to form a relatively complex, **distinct section** of an interface.
- Example: _Navigation bar_ or _Footer_

## Templates

- A group of organism forms a template.
- The design comes together in this stage.

## Pages

- A page is an instance of a template.
