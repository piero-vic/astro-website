Linux with Sway. I use this laptop for all my software development work.

## pi3b

I have a [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) which I use to run some
applications for personal use. I'm currently running:

- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), a web server with automatic HTTPS.
- [Glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance), a dashboard to put all my feeds in one place.
- [Baikal](https://sabre.io/baikal/), a CalDAV and CardDAV server.
- [Linkding](https://linkding.link/), a bookmark manager.
- [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app), a feed reader.
- [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/), a software forge.
