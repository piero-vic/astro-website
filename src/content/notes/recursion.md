- A function that call itself until a problem is solved. The point at which the problem is solved is called **base
  case**.
- It's good to think about function calls as a [stack](stack). Even the segment of memory that is used for function
  calls is also called stack.
- Recursion can be broken down into three steps:
  - Pre: Operations before recursion.
  - Recursion: The function call.
  - Post: Operations after recursion.
