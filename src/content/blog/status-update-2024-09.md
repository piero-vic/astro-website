## Reading

I haven't been reading much since the last time I wrote. But for the last couple of months I've been trying to keep up
with the things I enjoy the most. I finished two books this month:
[Rhythm of War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49021976-rhythm-of-war) and
[Four Thousand Weeks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks)

Rhythm of War wasn't my favorite book out of The Stormlight Archive, but somehow Sanderson makes me have the same
excitement I had when starting the series. The plot thickens with every book. I cannot wait for all to pay off when
[Wind and Truth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203578847-wind-and-truth) is released.

I think Four Thousand Weeks ended up in [my list](/notes/books) after hearing a recommendation on a podcast. I don't
really remember. It's not the kind of book I'll usually read, but Oliver Burkeman did provide a few ideas worth thinking
about.

## Watching

I haven't watched many movies these last few months but
[Kingdom of the Planet](https://letterboxd.com/film/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes/) of the Apes is my favorite movie
of the year so far.

My brother also got me into watching wrestling. It all started with WrestleMania XL early this year, and I've been
getting into it since then.

## Gaming

I started playing [Valheim](https://www.valheimgame.com/) after realizing that it isn't that hard to play games on Linux
anymore. I've running Steam though Flatpak on Arch Linux and haven't had any issues so far.

## Coding

A few weeks ago I wrote [go-linkding](https://github.com/piero-vic/go-linkding), a small Go package to interact with
[Linkding](https://linkding.link/). I'm working on two personal projects that make calls to the Linkding API, so I
decided to extract the code into a package and publish it.
