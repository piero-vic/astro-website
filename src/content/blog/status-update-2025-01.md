## Personal

Last month I decided to give [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) a try. If you don't know what it is, I would describe it
as a markup language with a strong focus on task management and note-taking. One thing worth mentioning is that Org Mode
is almost exclusively used in conjunction with Emacs. I'm not really an Emacs guy or at least I haven't been converted
yet. For the time being, I've been using on [nvim-orgmode/orgmode](https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode) with Neovim.

Org Mode is great. It scratches my itch for organization software. However, I've decided to not adopt it fully for now.
The main reason is that Org Mode seems like a good system for busy people, but my current workload is low, and the use
of system like this might be overkill. Also, I already have a bunch of [notes](/notes) written in Markdown. I don't want
to deal with migrating them to another format since I'll have to rework my publishing setup. For now, the only thing I'm
using Org Mode for is to track my workouts.

## Reading

I finish [Leviathan Wakes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8855321-leviathan-wakes). I've heard amazing things about
The Expanse and this book in particular, but I didn't like it that much.

The other book I read this month was [Co-Intelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198678736-co-intelligence).
While it provided some interesting insights, I don't think I got much out of it. Maybe because I work on tech, and I've
been already bombarded with content discussing the topic of AI and LMMs.

I wouldn't recommend it if you are already familiar with LLMs. The group of people that would benefit the most of this
book are people who are not that familiar with AI or tech in general.

## Coding

I'm currently working on a web application to track my workouts. It will be focused on weight lifting since it is what I
do, but I might add support for other forms of training in the future. The main goal is to have app that is easy to use
and that I can host myself. I'll release it with open source license when it is ready.
