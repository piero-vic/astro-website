## Personal

I made a trip to Santiago de Chile to visit some friends I hadn't seen in a while. I traveled with just one backpack
containing all the things I thought I would need. However, I ended up taking with me a bunch of clothes I didn't get to
wear.

My brother gave me an analog camera, and I was planning to take it with me on the trip. However, I decided not to due to
lens caps being missing. I didn't want to take the risk to scratch the lens. I found some 3D models on Thingiverse that
would work for the lens, but I still need to fix an old 3d printer I have at home to print the
[front](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6115527) and [rear](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6061109) caps for the
lens.

## Reading

I started to read [Understanding Distributed Systems](https://understandingdistributed.systems/) since I want to get
more familiar with system design and backend development.

## Watching

I watched two movies this month.

- [Cure](https://letterboxd.com/film/cure/)
- [Look Back](https://letterboxd.com/film/look-back-2024/)

## Coding

I haven't been coding much lately, but I wrote [volume-notify](https://github.com/piero-vic/volume-notify), a small
program show notifications on volume changes using PulseAudio. The idea came from a
[shell script by Hugo Osvaldo Barrera](https://git.sr.ht/~whynothugo/dotfiles/tree/72e90546fda70e700b963528a2e0afd15bfb4e84/item/home/.local/lib/volctld)
that does basically the same thing. I decided to build my own version using Go and later came across a similar project
called [pa-notify](https://github.com/ikrivosheev/pa-notify) which is written in C.
