Astro let's me use other libraries and frameworks like React and Vue on top of it. In my opinion it's the best tool to explore multiple frameworks in one project.\nThis is my personal playground. Things might change a lot through time so feel free to check the code on GitHub if somethig chatch your eye. I'm also planing to include a blog section.",
